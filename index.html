            Motivation
        </h2>
        <p>Apprentice Learning is a community-based nonprofit organization in Boston focused
            on providing career education for young students, and one of the main avenues through
            which they accomplish this goal is the City Summer Internship (CSI). Established particularly
            for rising ninth grade girls, CSI pairs students with companies, their ‘worksite partners’,
            where they will intern over the course of the summer. The program provides students with
            real-world workplace experience, receiving a paycheck while simultaneously building a
            foundational skill set and gaining firsthand knowledge about what it means to be a working
            professional. CSI also emphasizes the variety of opportunities available to students by
            allowing them to explore several fields of interest through seminars and career chats.</p>
        <p>Apprentice Learning asked us to primarily look at how the CSI program has
            impacted both their community and individual students. With these goals in mind, we decided to
            focus on demographic data, career chat survey data, and post-program survey data.
            Demographic data, such as students’ race, school, and neighborhood, helped us gauge
            what communities the CSI program is impacting and represent the reach of Apprentice Learning across Boston.
            The career chat surveys additionally
            allowed us to summarize what students are gaining from the career chat portion of the program. And finally,
            the
            post-program survey data was useful for identifying students’ individual growth as a result of
            the CSI program as well as noticing any trends in the overall impact of the program.

        <a id='data'></a>
        <h2> <br>
            Data</h2>
        <p>The data obtained from Apprentice Learning was comprised of both
            internal data as well as various survey results from 2020 and 2021. The internal data was primarily
            quantitative, composed of overall program counts and percentages. The survey data, on
            the other hand, was qualitative, with a variety of yes/no, ranking, and free response
            questions. There were 38 students enrolled in the CSI during 2021 and 37 students enrolled in 2020, but
            data was not consistently reported for all participants.</p>

        <h4>Demographic & Attendance Data</h4>
        <p>The data received for 2020 and 2021 regarding demographics can be summarized
            into four categories: student ethnicity, gender, neighborhood of residence, and current school. Since one of
            Apprentice Learning's main goals for the project was to visualize their community impact, we decided to
            utilize
            this data in our visualization because it is the primary source of community data and it allows us to
            identify which
            geographical and ethnic groups the program is reaching. Because the CSI program is designed for girls, the
            gender data was not significant
            for the visualization. All demographic data gathered was categorical.</p>
        <p>CSI attendance data was also received from Apprentice Learning, which detailed the percentage of students who
            participated each week
            of the program in 2020 and 2021. Although this data could be interesting to analyze in the future, it did
            not
            answer the primary question concerning CSI's impact, so we decided to exclude it.</p>

        <h4>Worksite Partner Data and Surveys</h4>
        <p>We also received surveys about students’ experiences with each worksite partner.
            These surveys ranged from having 3 respondents to 32 respondents. All students were given the same survey
            regardless of worksite partner, consisting of ordinal data in the form of yes/no or agree/disagree answers
            as well as free response answers, which could be considered categorical data. The ordinally-structured
            questions asked students to rate how they enjoyed learning about the worksite partner, how
            they would rate the conversations, and whether they are now more interested in a career
            related to the worksite partner’s field. The free response questions asked what their
            favorite moment was from the day, what could be improved, and how the conversation
            might help them in the future.</p>
        <p>We decided not to include this data for several reasons. The data resulting from the students' rating of the
            conversations, enjoyment during the
            conversation, improvement suggestions, and favorite moment of the day was not very applicable for analyzing
            the
            impact of the program overall. In addition, the prompt regarding whether they are more interested in a
            career related to the worksite partner's field was
            certainly related to the program's impact on students, but through our preliminary visualizations we
            realized that this data would
            not be very conclusive; there were enough students that responded 'no' to render the difference
            between the 'yes' and 'no' groups relatively insignificant. We also were unsure how selective the students
            can
            be regarding the worksite that they are paired with, and so there may have been some initial bias in their
            responses if some of them started the program knowing they
            would not enter that particular field in the future. For both of these reasons, this prompt was not included
            in the final
            visualizations. Lastly, the data concerning how the worksite partner experience
            might help them in the future was promising, but the responses were heavily variable and worksite-dependent
            and so could not be summarized or visualized in a meaningful way. However, this was also very similar to a
            post-program survey question that
            we did select for the final visualization (explained below) which summarized the program's impact on the
            students much more clearly.

        <h4>Post-Program Surveys</h4>
        <p>Several surveys were conducted investigating the overall impact of CSI on the
            students, as well as the students’ attitudes towards the program once it had ended. The
            post-program surveys were composed primarily of ordinal data in the form of yes/no and
            agree/disagree answers, but also included categorical responses in either free response or
            multiple choice format. There were a multitude of survey questions included, with 81 total
            questions from the two 2021 surveys combined, and so it would not be possible to include
            all of the data in our analysis. Several areas of the survey were more individual-based and
            unrepresentative of the program or its impact, such as the prompts ‘I have good friends
            here’ and ‘It's easy for me to join a new group of students’, and so we chose to omit this
            type of data. There were also some questions that may prove helpful for an internal review
            of the program, including ‘What suggestions do you have for making City Summer
            Internship better for the interns who come after you?’ and ‘What type of readiness was
            most important to you this summer?’ among others, but they were excluded because we
            wanted to drive our data analysis towards the production of a comprehensive overview of
            the program’s impact.</p>
        <p>With this goal in mind, we selected specific survey questions to include based on
            their ability to illuminate the program’s effectiveness as a whole. We felt that the prompts
            ‘Identify one strength you gained during CSI’ and ‘What is one thing you learned during the career chat?’
            were highly illustrative of the student-specific impact of both the program overall and the career chat
            portion
            of the program, as opposed to the more rigid yes/no prompts, and so we focused primarily on this data in the
            final
            visualization.</p>
        <p>In terms of 2020 post-program data obtained, there was little overlap between the
            2020 and 2021 post-program surveys, with different questions asked on each year’s survey,
            and so the 2020 post-program data was not included. We also chose not to include the
            data from a 2020 pre-program survey in our analysis because there was no 2021
            pre-program survey data for comparison and the standalone 2020 data is no longer current.

            Task Analysis
        </h2>
        <p>The interview with the Apprentice Learning crew was very insightful, as they answered all of our questions to
            the
            best of their knowledge, clearly expressed their enthusiasm for the project, and seemed open to any ideas or
            suggestions from us. They explained the city summer internship's structure in more detail than it is laid
            out on the webiste,
            clarifying that it is a paid weekly internship for rising 9th grade girls which also includes visits to
            different areas of employment in Boston. We were additionally
            interested to hear if there was anything they wanted to do differently from visualizations on previous
            annual
            reports. They seemed satisfied with the previous reports and provided us with data from several additional
            years prior, but remained open to new types of visualizations
            as well. Overall, as far as we understood, their main goal for the project was to visualize the program's
            impact and general success,
            as well as the growth of the program if possible. The long-term aim was to use these visualizations to
            gain interest in the program, potentially through their LinkedIn, Instagram, and other social media
            platforms.
            We decided to focus primarily on the program's success and impact on students and in the community, as we
            were not provided with sufficient data to analyze the
            program's growth.</p>

        <div class="sketches">

            </figure>
        </div>

        <p>For our initial design sketches, we attempted to tackle the tasks of summarizing impact on both community and
            students as well as program growth.</p>
        <p>Sketch 1 focused on community impact, using points and areas on a map to represent the schools and
            neighborhoods
            represented in the program respectively. The color of each neighborhood identified the number of students in
            the
            program from each neighborhood, and the size of the points encode the number of students from each school.
            The ethnicities of the students were
            also identified in the pie chart. This visualization formed the platform upon which we would center our
            final visualization, as we found it
            clearly displayed the reach of the program as well as the communities involved. However, we decided to
            dismiss the idea of changing
            the size of the school points, as it introduced occlusion and could be easily represented by a
            detail-on-demand feature.</p>
        <p>Sketch 2 focused on student impact in particular, with bar charts used to visualize student survey answers to
            both ‘before and after’ questions and ‘how has CSI prepared you for the future,’
            which we felt were highly representative of the program's impact on individuals.
            We were initially under the impression that we would be able to obtain pre-program data from 2021 and so it
            was
            included in the sketch, but upon learning that no pre-program survey was given to students in 2021, we had
            to dismiss the 'Before and
            After CSI' graphs. The 'strength gained' word cloud proved impactful and so was preserved for the final
            visualization, as it
            clearly expressed the impact from the students' point of view in a personal manner. Upon further analysis,
            we noticed that the
            'How has CSI prepared you for your future' bar graph contained many of the same results as the 'strength
            gained' component, and so it was removed from the final
            visualization to prevent overlap.</p>
        <p>Sketch 3 attempted to address the task of analyzing program growth by visualizing the number of students
            enrolled
            in the program per year. However, we were not able to secure the data needed for the graph
            as we only had access to 2020 and 2021 data.</p>

        <h4>Final Sketches</h4>
        <div class="sketches">
            <figure class="finalSketch">
                <img class="image" src="./images/final viz sketch 1 - liz.jpg" alt="Sketch 4">

            </figure>
        </div>

        <p>The final sketches preserved the successful components of the initial sketches while incorporating
            interaction.
            Both sketches utilized the map as a primary component, addressing the impact of the program on the community
            by
            incorporating the neighborhoods involved as well as the number of students from each area. The two ideas
            diverged from there,
            with Sketch 4 assessing student-based impact and Sketch 5 assessing the program's growth. These formed two
            distinct directions
            for the final visualization. Sketch 4 preserved the 'strength gained' word cloud from Sketch 2, and included
            a pie chart indicating how
            interested the students were in their worksite partner's industry after the program. This sketch
            incorporated linking between graphs
            based on areas of the map selected; when a neighborhood was clicked, the two visualizations to the side of
            the map would display
            the data only of students from that area. Sketch 5, on the other hand, preserved the ethnicity pie chart
            from Sketch 1 and included an additional bar graph indicating the number of students enrolled in 2020 and
            2021.
            This sketch incorporated linking between graphs based on the year selected; when a bar was hovered over in
            the bar graph, only the data
            from that year would be displayed in the other two components.</p>
        <p>We decided to combine the two ideas, keeping the 'Ethnicities' pie chart
            from Sketch 5 and the emphasis on student impact as well as the map-based interactions from Sketch 4. We
            made
            this decision because we felt that displaying the impact of the program on students was given much more
            emphasis in our initial
            project dicussions, and we thought that it could produce a much more personal and engaging visualization for
            the target audience. In
            addition, we had very little overlapping data between 2020 and 2021 (detailed further in the Data section)
            as opposed to the abundance of
            survey questions assessing the impact of the program on students, which left map-based linking to
            student-specific data as the obvious choice.
            The chart assessing students' interest in their worksite partner's industry was excluded as well, as
            explained in the Data section above. It was instead
            replaced by the bubble chart displaying career chat survey data, which allowed us to gauge the impact of
            several different aspects of the
            program on the students.

            Data Exploration: The Impact of CSI on Students and Community
        </h2>

        <p>The map of Boston displays the neighborhoods students are from, the number of students from each 
             neighborhood, and the schools that the students attend. The number of students 
             from each neighborhood is represented by the shade of green, with darker green
            representing more students.
        </p>
        <p>The pie chart displays the ethnicities of the students enrolled in the CSI program, with larger wedges representing a greater number of students of that ethnicity.</p>
        <p>The word cloud displays the main takeaways and lessons learned from the CSI career chats, where
            industry professionals led discussions about their job, career path, and industry. This data came from
            student surveys, and we grouped the students' generic short answer responses into several common categories.
            The larger the word,
            the more students who had that same main takeaway.
        </p>
        <p>The bubble chart displays the strengths students felt that they gained during their CSI internship
            experience. This data also came from
            student surveys, and the short answer responses were once again grouped into broader categories. The larger
            the
            bubble, the more students who felt that they gained that strength.

        <h4>How to Use</h4>
            <p>This visualizaiton gives you the freedom to explore the data and decide what information you would like to see.</p>
    
            <p>Above the pie chart, 
            there are three checkboxes that display the indicated information on the visualization when selected.</p>

            <p>To view data for a specific school(s), create a 'brush': use the mouse to click, hold, and drag over the schools you want to include in the
            data. The other visualizations will change based on the schools that were picked, including only the data from students attending the selected schools. The name of the schools 
            in the brush will be displayed on the map next to their respective dots, and the colors of the neighborhods will also update to reflect the selected cohort of students.
            You can move the brush around the map by dragging it, and you can also resize it by dragging any of its corners.</p>

           <p>To see the number of students of each ethnicity in the pie chart, use the mouse to hover over the corresponding slice of the chart. The same method can also be used to 
           see the number of students per response in the "What Students Learned From Career Chat" world cloud, this time by hovering over a word. </p>

        <h2>
            <br>
            Data Analysis
        </h2>
        <h4>Strengths Gained During CSI</h4>
        <p>Since the goal of the City Summer Internship program, as well as Apprentice
            Learning as a whole, is to prepare students for their future careers, we wanted to emphasize
            the impact of the program on the students with our visualizations. The word cloud displays
            the generic answers to the question ‘What is one strength you gained during CSI?’ from the
            2021 post-CSI survey. The students had a variety of responses, and the most common response was
            ‘Confidence’.
            The answers ranged from career-specific strengths to overall personal development, indicative of the
            program’s effectiveness in developing life skills as well as facilitating career preparation.

        <h4>The Career Chat Experience</h4>
        <p>One primary aspect of the CSI program is the career chat, which allows students to explore a
            field of interest by inviting individuals from various fields to present and discuss with
            students. The bubble chart displays the summary of students’ responses to the question
            ‘What is one thing you learned from the career chat?’ from the Career Chat CSI 2021
            student survey dataset. When visualizing and summarizing the impact of the program on
            the students, we wanted to include the impact of the career chat in particular because it is
            a main feature of the program, and we felt that this question best summarized this impact.
            While responses to the prompt varied, ‘Field insight’ was by
            far the primary takeaway from the chats, demonstrating that the career chat is successful
            in allowing the students to further investigate fields they may be interested in.</p>

        <h4>Student Ethnicities</h4>
        <p>Ethnicities play a big role in defining and understanding the student body of any school or program. Since
            the students
            are at the heart of the program's mission, we wanted to understand the compilation of the student population
            as well
            as the program's diversity, and we found that the student ethnicity data was the best choice. As shown in
            the pie chart, there was a
            spread of student ethnicities represented, with a majority of students identifying as black.</p>

        <h4>Neighborhoods and Schools Represented</h4>
        <p>One final task that was at the heart of this project was to identify CSI's impact on the community. To
            satisfy this
            goal, we chose the map to display the neighborhoods and schools represented, which displays the
            comprehensive nature of
            the program and indicates which areas and schools
            are impacted by (and involved in) the program most. As displayed in the visualization, the CSI program's
            impact is
            far-reaching throughout Boston, with 35% of the neighborhoods represented in the program. Also, the majority
            of the student population lives in
            Dorchester, and a large portion of the students attend Dearborn STEM Academy.

        <h2>
            <br>
            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>For this project, we analyzed Apprentice Learning's CSI data and created a final visualization that displayed
            this
            data in a meaningful way to program stakeholders, students and families, and those who may be curious about
            the
            CSI program. We hope that Apprentice Learning can use this visualization to better understand their impact
            on their
            students and community.
        </p>
        <p>As for future work, we think it would be useful to implement an easy method for importing new data into this 
            visualization so that Apprentice Learning can use the visualization in future years as they accumulate new data. 
            We also wish we were able to include multiple years of data in this visualization, but different survey data was collected each year. 
            This issue can be resolved for future years, however, and the visualization could certainly be expanded to include multiple years worth of data.
